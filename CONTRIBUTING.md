# How To Contribute

Contributions are welcome as we strive to make this application as useful as
possible for everyone. However time is not always on our side, and changes may
not be reviewed or merged in a timely manner.

If this application is found to be missing in functionality, please open an
issue describing the proposed change - discussing changes ahead of time reduces
friction within pull requests.
